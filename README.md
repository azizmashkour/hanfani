# 📈 TrendAnalyst AI

> **Bridging Google Trends and Social Intelligence with Autonomous AI Agents.**

TrendAnalyst AI is a high-performance, open-source intelligence platform designed to not only track what is trending but to explain **why** it matters. By combining real-time data from Google Trends with social media context, it empowers users to turn raw data into actionable goals via a dedicated AI agent.

## 🚀 The Ambition
Our goal is to build a transparent, community-driven tool that provides:
1. **Automated Discovery:** Real-time fetching of Google Trends data.
2. **Contextual Intelligence:** Cross-referencing trends with social media signals.
3. **Agentic Guidance:** An AI agent that clarifies user intent and directs them toward their specific goals.
4. **Developer Excellence:** A "one feature a day" delivery model with strict JSDoc, high-quality tests, and automated CI/CD.
